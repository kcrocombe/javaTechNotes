This repository (javaTechNotes) collects together all the notes I've written while investigatin various Java related technologies. It is not a project that will ever be done. I am expecting to be continaually adding to them.

The notes themselves are text files marked up for APT and then rendered to HTML via the Apache Doxia system (itself described inthe documentation)
