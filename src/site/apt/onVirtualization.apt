Other Virttualizatoin Technologies


  KVM - Kernel Based Virtualisation (KVM) is a open source virtualization technology built into Linux. It lets you turn Linux into a hypervisor. It is present on all verions of Linux since about 2007, but NEEDS to be installed on Hardware that supports Virtualisation.


Hypervisors

  A hypervisoer is a virtula machine monitor; it enable the creation, and running of virtul machines. The hypervisor presents the guest operating system with a virtual operating platform () and manages the execution of the guest operating system.

  Multiple instances of diffferent opeating systems may share the virtualized hardware resourecs. This is in contrast to operating-system-level virtualisation where containers share a sinlge kernel.

Hypervisors may be:

  * Native or Bare-Metal Hyervisors - These Hypervisors are run directly on the hosts hardware, i.e. they are installed direclt to the bare in place of a normal operating system. Example of Bare Metal Hypervisors are

    * VMware ESXi

    * Oracle VM Server

    []


  * Hosted Hypervisor - These run on a conventional operating system like any other application. Examples of Hypervisor products are:

    * VMware

    * VirtualBox

    * QEMU

  Linuxs KVM blurs the distinction a bit. KVM is a kernel module that efffectively converts the host operating system to a Bare Metal Hypervisor, but at the same time is still a general purpose operating system.


qcow and qcomw2

  qcow (QEMU Copy On Write) is a file format for disk image files used by QEMU. Its primary feature is that is uses a disk storage optimisatin strategythat delays allocation of storage untilit is actually needed. So raw disk images can be represented within files that are actually mutach smaller than that raw-image.


QEMU

  QEMU ( Quick Emulator) is an open source hosted virtual machine monitor ( Hypervisor). Bits of it have been incorporated into Virtual Box etc.


Libvirt

  Is an opensource project that provides an API toolkit to manage various Virtualisation platforms including KVM, VMWare, QEMU.

Virsh

  is a commandline tool that uses the LIbvirt API. IS used to manipulte various virtual machines.
